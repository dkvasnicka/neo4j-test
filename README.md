neo4j-test
==========

Just a quick Neo4J PoC written during some boring talk on a conference, more than a year ago. I just thought this mind excercise might help someoneâ€¦ or actually warn them :)

The objective of this mission was to try to wrap a Neo4J node in a bean-like class so that it can be used in various templating engines that acces properties like "bean.something".
