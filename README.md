neo4j-test
==========

Just a quick Neo4J PoC written during some boring talk on a conference, more than a year ago. I just thought this mind excercise might help someoneâ€¦ or actually warn them :) Yes, I know there is Spring Data for Neo4J - there just wasn't anything like that at the time I had this idea...

The objective of this mission was to try to wrap a Neo4J node in a bean-like class so that it can be used in various templating engines that acces properties like "bean.something".

Recently rewrote most of it to Scala. Just an exercise, nothing less, nothing more :)
